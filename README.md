 Polygon Colorizer with Conditional UNet

This project implements a Conditional UNet model from scratch in PyTorch to colorize polygon images based on a given color name. The model takes in a grayscale polygon image and a textual color prompt (like `"red"`) and outputs a colored version of the same shape.
